# example_repo

This is an example work environment in which I am learning to use Git connection. Commit and add notes to keep thoughts organized!!! will this acknowledge change?

If working with a collaborators, commit first, pull collaborator's changes and then push forward so everything is incorporated. The collaborator would pull to have changes exist in your computer. 

When someone is added as a colaborator, you need to clone/download, create a new project with the link, and it will join the already existing project detail.
